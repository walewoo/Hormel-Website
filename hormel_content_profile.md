\#\# ABOUT HORMEL

\#\#\# Company Overview

Hormel Company Limited is Nigeria's premier Asset Management and Real Estate Advisory firm, established in 2009 to bridge the gap between traditional property services and sophisticated wealth management. We have evolved from a property servicing company into a strategic partner for capital deployment, serving High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs), Institutional Investors, Diaspora clients, and Government bodies.

Our approach transcends conventional real estate brokerage. We engineer value through rigorous, data-driven methodologies that ensure every investment decision is backed by comprehensive intelligence, regulatory compliance, and a clear path to profitability. At Hormel, we don't merely facilitate transactions—we architect wealth preservation strategies and structure inflation-proof portfolios designed to withstand Nigeria's dynamic economic landscape.

\#\#\# Our Vision

To be the definitive Knowledge Leader in African real estate, empowering clients to achieve sovereign-level stability and institutional-grade returns through unparalleled market intelligence and strategic asset positioning.

\#\#\# Our Mission

To bridge the gap between local market realities and global investment standards by providing the technical insight, due diligence rigor, and strategic guidance required for high-impact developments, sustainable wealth creation, and portfolio optimization across the Nigerian real estate ecosystem.

\#\#\# Our Core Value: PERFORMANCE

At Hormel, PERFORMANCE is not merely a metric—it is the DNA of our organizational culture. It defines our unwavering commitment to delivering tangible, measurable results, whether securing a Certificate of Occupancy for a government partner, achieving double-digit yields for private investors, or executing complex Public-Private Partnership structures.

\*\*Our Guiding Principles:\*\*

\- \*\*Precision\*\* – We measure twice and execute once. Our due diligence processes are exhaustive, leaving no stone unturned in risk assessment.  
\- \*\*Innovation\*\* – We pioneer emerging asset classes—from Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) to Industrial Logistics—often identifying opportunities before they enter mainstream consciousness.  
\- \*\*Integrity\*\* – We provide unbiased, objective counsel. If an investment opportunity doesn't align with your objectives or risk profile, we will advise you to walk away. Your success is our reputation.  
\- \*\*Intelligence\*\* – Every recommendation is underpinned by comprehensive market research, forensic title verification, and financial modeling that meets institutional investment standards.

\#\# OUR STRATEGIC SERVICE DIVISIONS

Hormel's expertise is structured into three specialized divisions, each designed to address the distinct requirements of our diverse client base.

\---

\#\#\# DIVISION I: PRIVATE WEALTH & DIASPORA ADVISORY

\*\*Target Clientele:\*\* High-Net-Worth Individuals, Diaspora Investors, Family Offices

\*\*Strategic Focus:\*\* Wealth Preservation, Inflation Hedging & Legacy Building

For our private clients, real estate represents more than property—it is a vehicle for intergenerational wealth transfer and protection against economic volatility. We serve as wealth architects, curating portfolios that deliver both capital preservation and consistent income generation.

\#\#\#\# Core Services

\*\*Inflation-Proof Portfolio Construction\*\*

We curate high-yield, recession-resistant assets specifically designed to hedge against currency devaluation and generate predictable cash flows. Our focus areas include Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA), premium short-let apartments in high-demand locations, and commercial properties with long-term anchor tenants.

\*\*Diaspora Investment Concierge\*\*

A comprehensive, transparent end-to-end investment management service that enables Nigerians abroad to invest securely without physical presence. We handle every aspect from initial opportunity identification and title verification to property acquisition, documentation, tenant placement, and ongoing asset management. Our monthly reporting ensures full transparency and peace of mind.

\*\*Strategic Asset Management\*\*

We don't simply hand over keys—we actively manage your investment to ensure it remains a performing asset rather than becoming a liability. Our services include proactive tenant management, preventive maintenance scheduling, rental income optimization, and strategic repositioning recommendations to maximize capital appreciation.

\*\*Family Office Real Estate Services\*\*

For ultra-high-net-worth families, we provide bespoke portfolio management services including estate consolidation, legacy planning, and multi-generational wealth structuring through real estate vehicles.

We present only those industrial, commercial, and residential opportunities that have successfully passed our rigorous three-tier internal audit process: (1) Title and Legal Verification, (2) Structural and Technical Assessment, and (3) Commercial Viability and Cash Flow Modeling. Every opportunity arrives investment-ready with comprehensive documentation packages.

\*\*Industrial & Logistics Real Estate\*\*

Capitalizing on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) momentum, we source and structure investments in prime industrial land, warehousing facilities, and logistics hubs along strategic corridors including the Lekki Free Trade Zone, Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, and emerging industrial clusters in Ogun and Oyo States.

\*\*Market Intelligence & Research\*\*

Our quarterly Intelligence Reports provide institutions with data-backed insights on yields, occupancy rates, rental trends, and asset performance across sectors and geographies. We deliver the "ground truth" necessary for confident capital allocation decisions, backed by proprietary research methodologies.

We conduct comprehensive audits of existing institutional real estate holdings, identifying underperforming assets, recommending strategic disposals, and restructuring portfolios to optimize risk-return profiles in alignment with regulatory requirements.

\*\*Joint Venture Structuring\*\*

Our PPP structuring expertise ensures risk transfer, bankability, and long-term sustainability while protecting public interest.

We provide comprehensive economic impact assessments of proposed government infrastructure projects, analyzing effects on surrounding property valuations, urban development patterns, and potential for transit-oriented development (TOD) strategies.

\*\*Estate Regularization Programs\*\*

We design and implement frameworks for the regularization of informal settlements and illegal developments, creating pathways for compliance that generate revenue for government while providing security of tenure for residents.

\*\*Policy Advisory & Research\*\*
