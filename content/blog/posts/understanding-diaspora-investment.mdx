## Why Nigerian Real Estate Appeals to Diaspora Investors

For millions of Nigerians living abroad, investing in real estate back home represents more than just a financial opportunity — it's a connection to heritage, a pathway to generational wealth, and a strategic diversification of global assets.

The Nigerian real estate market, particularly in cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt, has shown consistent long-term appreciation despite short-term volatility. For diaspora investors, this presents a unique opportunity to leverage currency advantages while building a tangible asset portfolio.

## Key Considerations Before Investing

### 1. Legal Framework and Title Verification

Understanding Nigeria's land tenure system is crucial. The Land Use Act of 1978 vests all land in each state's governor, making the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) the most reliable proof of ownership. Before any investment, ensure:

- **Title search** at the relevant land registry
- **Survey verification** to confirm boundaries
- **Governor's consent** for any transfers
- **Tax clearance** certificates are in order

### 2. Market Research and Location Analysis

Not all Nigerian real estate markets are created equal. Key factors to evaluate include:

- **Infrastructure development** — proximity to roads, airports, and utilities
- **Demographic trends** — population growth and urbanization patterns
- **Regulatory environment** — zoning laws and development restrictions
- **Rental yield potential** — current market rates and occupancy levels

### 3. Professional Advisory Team

Working with a reputable advisory firm is non-negotiable. Your team should include:

- A licensed real estate advisor with local market expertise
- A real estate attorney for legal due diligence
- A qualified surveyor for property inspection
- A property manager for ongoing asset management

## Risk Management Strategies

### Diversification

Don't concentrate all investments in a single location or property type. Spread across residential, commercial, and mixed-use developments in different cities to mitigate location-specific risks.

### Regular Reporting and Monitoring

Insist on monthly reporting from your property manager, including occupancy rates, rental income, maintenance costs, and market updates.

### Documentation and Compliance

Maintain meticulous records of all transactions, ensure tax compliance in both Nigeria and your country of residence, and keep all property documents in a secure, accessible location.
